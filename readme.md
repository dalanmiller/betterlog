###What is the purpose of this site?

To make searching for classes at CMU Heinz a little bit easier. Currently it's not that good of an experience and all the classes are limited to a very small window which is not responsive and does not load quickly. Using simple filters and other improvements to the user experience searching for classes can be a much smoother experience. 

###What do you want the web site to accomplish?

I want to the website to ease the search of finding the courses they would like to take for a CMU Heinz student.

###Who is your intended audience?

My intended audience are CMU Heinz students and potentially prospective students allowing them to easily search through the class offerings.

###What type of content might be included in your site?

Information about course offerings at CMU Heinz.

###Future features

I think a couple very useful features which don't exist currently on the CMU Heinz SIO website for students is to assemble different possible course schedules and then visualize them onto a weekly calendar. Right now now on the SIO website it's a very slow and ajax-y affair. Allowing students to layout their possible options would be beneficial to them in picking out their ideal course schedules. 

* Select different courses and visualize them on a week layout calendar.
* Identify class time conflicts and suggest best possible configuration knowing different class time possibilities (sections).
* Allow user to download calendar layout as .ics
* Allow users to provide feedback on course and course content.
* Get notifications on their mobile device when registration is available for them.
* Get notifications on their mobile device when a 'watched' course currently opens up a spot for them.
